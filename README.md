## Sketchit ðŸŽ¨
A fun app to turn images or photos into awesome pencil sketch masterpieces using Computer Vision and the the openCv library. I am particularly fascinated by the field of Computer Vision and how it trains machines to interpret and understand the visual world and am intrigued by the seemingly endless array of real-world applications.
